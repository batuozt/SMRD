# SMRD: SURE-Based Robust MRI Reconstruction with Diffusion Models

Our repository has moved to https://github.com/NVlabs/SMRD. Please follow the link to access our code. This repository implements two papers for diffusion model based MRI reconstruction:

1. SMRD: SURE-Based Robust MRI Reconstruction with Diffusion Models. MICCAI 2023 (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43898-1_20)

2. Regularization by Denoising Diffusion Process for MRI Reconstruction. MIDL 2023 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=M1V498MXelq)
